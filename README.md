# Screenshot Bot
A small but convenient Windows tool to automatically take screenshots of your desktop for timelapses. The system is failsafe, because images are stored immediately. After your recording session, you can turn those images into a video with a selectable frame rate.

Initially made for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) gamedev event.
